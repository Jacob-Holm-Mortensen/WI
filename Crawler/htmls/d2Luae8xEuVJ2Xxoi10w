<p>THE APPLICATION (AS DEFINED BELOW) YOU ARE DOWNLOADING OR HAVE DOWNLOADED HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY CBS INTERACTIVE INC. OR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, “<strong>CBSi</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>”).  BY INSTALLING OR USING ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE APPLICATION, YOU ACCEPT ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (“<strong>AGREEMENT</strong>”).  UPON ACCEPTANCE, THIS AGREEMENT IS ENFORCEABLE AGAINST YOU AND ANY ENTITY THAT OBTAINED THE APPLICATION AND ON WHOSE BEHALF IT IS USED.  IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE APPLICATION.  ACCORDINGLY, YOU AND CBSi AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING:</p>

<p>The “<strong>Application</strong>” consists of: (a) the CBSi mobile application provided in connection with an authorized link to this Agreement, including all software, code, text, graphics, logos, layouts, designs, interfaces, and other items included in or associated with the application; and (b) any files that are delivered to you by CBSi (via online transmission, through a third party distributor, or otherwise) to patch, update, or otherwise modify the CBSi mobile application.</p>

<p>The Application may provide a means for you to access one or more websites, other applications, or other products and services offered by CBSi (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”), and audio and video materials, photographs, text, graphics, logos, layouts, designs, interfaces, software, data and other content associated with the Services (“<strong>Content</strong>”).  The Application, Services and Content are copyrighted works of CBSi and may contain trademarks, service marks, trade names, and other intellectual property of CBSi.</p>

<p>The Application and Content, and your use of the Services, are also subject to CBSi’s <a href="/legal/cbsi/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>, <a href="/legal/cbsi/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="/legal/cbsi/privacy-policy/video-services-and-social-networking">Video Services and Social Networking Policy</a> (collectively “<strong>CBSi Terms</strong>”) which are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.  There may also be additional terms that CBSi presents to you in connection with the Application, for example, at the time of download (“<strong>Additional Terms</strong>”).  If there is a conflict between this Agreement and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless the Additional Terms expressly provide otherwise.</p>

<p>If you are obtaining the Application from a distribution channel such as the Apple App Store or the Android Marketplace (“<strong>Distribution Channel</strong>”), your purchase, if the application is paid, and any subscription, if the Application or its Content requires a subscription, may be subject to additional terms of the Distribution Channel.  This Agreement is between you and us only, and not with the Distribution Channel.  We, rather than the Distribution Channel, are responsible for the Application and the content thereof.  Neither we nor the Distribution Channel has any obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application.</p>

<p>The Application may use location-based services to locate you.  If you choose to use the Application, you consent to CBSi and its third party providers determining your location.</p>

<h5>9. Termination.</h5>

<p>This Agreement is effective until terminated.  You may terminate this Agreement at any time by: (i) irretrievably erasing, deleting, or destroying all copies of the Application in your possession or control; and (ii) ceasing to use the Services and Content available through the Application.  CBSi may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason or no reason.  However, if you paid CBSi or its authorized Distribution Channel to acquire the Application, and we terminate this Agreement within one year after you made your payment for reasons other than your breach of this Agreement or the CBSi Terms, we will refund a prorated portion of the purchase price corresponding to the portion of such one year period for which our action caused you not to be able to use the Application.  Upon termination for any reason, the license granted in Section 4 will immediately terminate.  The provisions in Sections 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13 will survive any termination.</p>

<h5>10. Export Controls.</h5>

<p>You will not ship, transfer, or export the Application into any country or use the Application in any manner prohibited by the United States Export Administration Act or any other export laws, restrictions, or regulations (collectively, “<strong>Export Laws</strong>”).  You represent and warrant that you are not a citizen of, and are not located within, a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that you are not otherwise prohibited under the Export Laws from receiving the Application.</p>

<h5>11. Governing Law, Venue, and Jurisdiction.</h5>

<p>This Agreement and all claims arising from or related to your use of the Application will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, except California’s conflict of law rules.  This Agreement and the Application will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, if applicable.</p>

<p>With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration (as set forth below), you agree to exclusive jurisdiction in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, we may seek injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, you must file any claim or action related to use of the Application or this Agreement within one year after such claim or action accrued. Otherwise, you will waive the claim or action.</p>

<h5>12. Disputes; Arbitration</h5>

<p>If you have any dispute with or claim against us or any of our affiliates (a “<strong>Claim</strong>”) arising out of or relating to the Application or this Agreement, and the claim is not resolved by calling our customer service department at (877) 814-7002, you and we each agree to resolve such disputes through an individual binding arbitration or an individual action in small claims court.  Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and your Claim may not be consolidated with any other person’s claim.  You and we agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This Section 12 shall survive termination of this Agreement or any subscription that you may have to receive Content.</p>

<p>Before you commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action with respect to your Claim, you must first send to CBS Interactive a written notice of your claim (“<strong>Notice</strong>”).  The Notice must (1) be sent by certified mail; (2) be addressed to: CBS Interactive, 235 Second Street, San Francisco, CA 94105 Attn: Legal Department; (3) describe the nature of your Claim; and (4) specify the damages or other relief you seek.  If we and you do not then resolve the Claim within 30 days after our receipt of your Notice is received, either you or we may commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action to resolve the Claim.</p>

<p>Any such arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association and be conducted in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, including the Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedures, if applicable (the “<strong>Rules</strong>”).  Contact information for the American Arbitration Association, as well as copies of the Rules and applicable forms, are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>.  In circumstances in which the Rules provide for an in-person hearing, such hearing will, at your request, take place in the U.S. county (or parish) of your residence, or otherwise in San Francisco, California.  For any non-frivolous Claim that does not exceed $50,000, CBS Interactive will pay all costs of the arbitration, and reimburse any filing fees you may be required to pay.  If the arbitrator awards you damages that are greater than CBS Interactive’s last written settlement offer communicated before commencement of the arbitration, CBS Interactive will pay you the greater of $1,000 or the amount of the award.</p>

<h5>13. Miscellaneous.</h5>
