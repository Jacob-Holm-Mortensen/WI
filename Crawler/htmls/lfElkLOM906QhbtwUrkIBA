The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p><p>Actor <strong>Harry Dean Stanton</strong> (July 14, 1926-Sept. 15, 2017) was widely loved by film and TV audiences attuned to the compassion and idiosyncratic humor he evoked in his long resume of eccentrics and characters on the fringes. He appeared in more than 200 movies and TV shows in a career dating to the mid-1950s, with a credit list ranging from cult favorites like ''Two-Lane Blacktop," "Escape From New York" and "Repo Man," to "Cool Hand Luke," "The Godfather Part II," "Wise Blood," "Straight Time," "Alien" and "Pretty in Pink"</p><p>Though usually playing supporting characters, Stanton shined in his lead role in Wim Wenders' 1984 road movie "Paris, Texas" (pictured), giving a poignant, near-wordless performance which he called his favorite. </p><p>Recently he reunited with director David Lynch to appear in the return of the TV series "Twin Peaks," reprising his role as the cranky trailer park owner Carl. He also starred in the upcoming film "Lucky."</p><p>Stanton, who never lost the accent from his home state of Kentucky, once said his interest in movies was piqued as a child when he would walk out of every theater "thinking I was Humphrey Bogart."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> 20th Century Fox</p>                    </li>

He helped pave the way for Bob Newhart, Woody Allen, Jerry Seinfeld and other standup comedians who fashioned their routines around the follies and frustrations of modern living. His first album, "Inside Shelley Berman," went gold and received the first-ever Grammy Award for the spoken word.</p><p>"I'm not a standup comedian," Berman often insisted. "I work on a stool."</p><p>He also managed to fulfill his ambitions as an actor, appearing on Broadway in "The Boys Against the Girls," and the musical, "A Family Affair." His film debut came in 1964 in the political drama "The Best Man," and he had a memorable turn in a "Twilight Zone" episode. For more than 20 years he taught comedy at the University of Southern California.</p><p>Late in his career, he played Nat David, father of Larry David, on HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm." With dialogue improvised by its cast, the comedy series gave Berman the opportunity to return to his improv roots and introduced him to a new generation of TV viewers.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP Photo</p>                    </li>

As Oscar Goldman, the intelligence agency mastermind behind the resurrection of a near-dead astronaut as a cyborg secret agent in "The Six Million Dollar Man" ("We can rebuild him. We have the technology. We can make him better than he was. Better &hellip; stronger &hellip; faster"), Anderson made government overseers cool.</p><p>A veteran of dozens of films (including "Forbidden Planet" and "Paths of Glory") and innumerable TV appearances, Anderson was a talented character actor who could, he once said, play "an Internal Revenue Service agent, a hanging judge, or the captain of a hell ship." But he is best remembered as the paternal Goldman, who was also a key figure in a spinoff series, "The Bionic Woman," in production at the same time (and for which he garnered an Emmy nomination). A tennis fan, Anderson jokingly told TV Guide in 1976, "Since I've been playing Oscar Goldman in both series at once, my doubles game has gotten a lot better."&nbsp;</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Universal Television</p>                    </li>

He got his wife to practice heckling him ("All the filthy words you could think [of]") so that he'd be ready for whatever the audience might say. When "The Tonight Show with Jack Paar" called to book him, he refused, knowing that black comics weren't invited to sit next to Paar after their routine. Paar himself called, and told Gregory, "Well, come on in, I'll let you sit down."</p><p>"It was sitting on the couch that made my salary grow in three weeks from $250 working seven days a week to $5,000 a night," Gregory told CBS News' Erin Moriarty in 2017. </p><p>But Gregory wanted more than just a seat at the table; he wanted to change America, and soon standup became sit-ins at civil rights rallies. He ran for president in 1968 (the same year Alabama Governor George Wallace, an avowed segregationist, had joined the race). His political views and anti-war hunger strikes cost him fans, money, and even time with his family.</p><p>But he saw his role of agitator as important.

With tracks including "Paper Cut," "One Step Close," "Crawling" and "In the End," Linkin Park's music explored such issues as cycles of abuse, the breakup of families, depression and addiction.

"They could be an avalanche, they could be a hurricane. It's a disaster out there. The stories are about how people fail to respond in the proper way. They fail to address it.

He toured with the play until it reached Los Angeles, where he began his film career.</p><p>With an expansive range and an unrivaled longevity, Landau was one of the profession's most adaptable students. He employed his chameleonic skills in his role as a master of disguise in the spy series "Mission: Impossible." He played an assassin in Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller, "North by Northwest," an adulterous husband in Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors," and a financier in Francis Ford Coppola's "Tucker: The Man and His Dream." But it was his performance in Tim Burton's 1994 film "Ed Wood" - playing horror film star Bela Lugosi - that earned Landau his craft's highest honor, the Academy Award. </p><p>In September 2012 Landau said, "All an audience wants to believe &hellip; is what's going on between two people is happening for the first time ever.

The 27-year-old packaged the Republican (then vying for a political comeback in the presidential race) in comfortably staged TV town-hall meetings as a man whose intelligence the audience would respect.

But it was as the originator of the "insult comic" genre that the nightclub entertainer and favorite guest of late-night talk-shows made his lasting mark. Despite his barbs ("Hello, dummy!"), Rickles' insults had little sting, which accounted for his counterintuitive nickname: Mr. Warmth.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Publicity Photo</p>                    </li>

He gained international acclaim with "Babi Yar," the unflinching 1961 poem that told of the slaughter of nearly 34,000 Jews by the Nazis and denounced the anti-Semitism that had spread throughout the Soviet Union.</p><p>In 2007 Yevtushenko told the Associated Press he wrote the poem after visiting the site of the mass killings in Kiev, Ukraine, and searching for something memorializing what happened there - a sign, a tombstone, some kind of historical marker - but finding nothing. "I was so shocked. I was absolutely shocked when I saw it, that people didn't keep a memory about it," he said.</p><p>At the height of his fame, Yevtushenko read his works in packed soccer stadiums and arenas, including to a crowd of 200,000 in 1991 that came to listen during a failed coup attempt in Russia. He also attracted large audiences on tours of the West, and settled in Oklahoma, teaching at the University of Tulsa. "He's more like a rock star than some sort of bespectacled, quiet poet," said former University of Tulsa President Robert Donaldson.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP Photo</p>                    </li>

He would go on to cover working stiffs, mobsters, city employees on the take, and big-city power brokers.

Pressed and self-released though his own record processing plant and label, Wilfilms Limited, Onyearbor's music was infectious and idiosyncratic, and proved a major influence for such artists as David Byrne.</p><p>Onyeabor never performed live, and later retreated from music to focus on his faith and business ventures, refusing interviews about his recording career. But a 2013 compilation album ("Who Is William Onyeabor?") and the documentary "Fantastic Man" introduced his work to a new generation.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Luaka Bop</p>                    </li>

"The Exorcist," published in 1971, told of a 12-year-old-girl inhabited by a Satanic force.</p><p>"Like so many Catholics, I've had so many little battles of wavering faith over the course of my life," Blatty (who would allege numerous mysterious events while working on the book) told IGN.com in 2000. "And when I heard about this case and read the details, that seemed so compelling. I thought, 'My God, if someone were to investigate this and authenticate it, what a tremendous boost to faith it would be.' I thought, 'Someday I would like to see that happen. You know, I would like to do it.'" The book spent more than a year on The New York Times fiction bestseller list, and became a blockbuster movie, for which Blatty (adapting his own novel) won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.</p><p>Less well-known was Blatty's mischievous streak, as when he impersonated a Saudi prince on Groucho Marx's "You Bet Your Life," extending the prank throughout Hollywood, where "Prince Xeer" always got the best tables.
